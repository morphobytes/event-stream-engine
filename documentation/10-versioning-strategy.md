# Event Stream Engine - Versioning Strategy

## Overview

The Event Stream Engine follows **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)** as the official versioning strategy for all releases. This industry-standard approach provides clear, consistent, and predictable versioning that enables stakeholders to understand the impact of each release.

## Semantic Versioning Format

The versioning format follows the pattern: **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
  │     │     │
  │     │     └── Backward-compatible bug fixes
  │     └────────── Backward-compatible new features
  └──────────────── Breaking changes (incompatible API changes)
```

### Current Version Status
- **Current Version:** `v4.1.0`
- **Release Date:** October 2025
- **Status:** Production-ready with comprehensive feature set

## Versioning Rules

### MAJOR Version (X.y.z)
**Increment when:** Making incompatible API changes that break existing integrations

**Impact on Consumers:** **High Risk** - Requires code changes to adapt

**Examples of MAJOR changes:**
- Changing core database schema (e.g., `phone_number` column type modification)
- Modifying existing API endpoint structures or removing endpoints
- Breaking changes to webhook payload formats
- Fundamental architecture changes requiring configuration updates
- Removing or significantly changing core functionality

**Version Example:** `4.1.0` → `5.0.0`

### MINOR Version (x.Y.z)  
**Increment when:** Adding functionality in a backward-compatible manner

**Impact on Consumers:** **Medium Risk** - Safe to upgrade, new features available

**Examples of MINOR changes:**
- New API endpoints for reporting or analytics
- Additional compliance features (CCPA support alongside existing GDPR)
- New campaign orchestration capabilities
- Enhanced monitoring and logging features
- New optional configuration parameters
- Performance improvements that don't break existing functionality

**Version Example:** `4.1.0` → `4.2.0`

### PATCH Version (x.y.Z)
**Increment when:** Making backward-compatible bug fixes or minor improvements

**Impact on Consumers:** **Low Risk** - Should upgrade without concerns

**Examples of PATCH changes:**
- Bug fixes in webhook processing logic
- Correcting Twilio error code handling
- Security patches that don't change functionality
- Documentation updates and corrections
- Minor performance optimizations
- Dependency updates (security patches)

**Version Example:** `4.1.0` → `4.1.1`

## Release Strategy Guidelines

| Change Type | Version Impact | Testing Requirements | Deployment Considerations |
|-------------|----------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| **Bug Fix** | PATCH | Unit tests + regression testing | Can be deployed immediately to production |
| **New Feature** | MINOR | Full integration testing + UAT | Staged rollout recommended |
| **Breaking Change** | MAJOR | Complete system testing + migration testing | Requires coordination with all stakeholders |

## Version History & Evolution

### Version 4.x Series (Current)
- **v4.1.0** (October 2025) - Environment management enhancements, production readiness improvements
- **v4.0.0** (October 2025) - Complete codebase cleanup, documentation consolidation, production deployment readiness

### Version 3.x Series
- **v3.0.0** - Outbound orchestration and campaign runner implementation

### Version 2.x Series  
- **v2.0.0** - Core compliance pipeline and TCPA/GDPR implementation

### Version 1.x Series
- **v1.0.0** - Initial webhook processing and data ingestion

## Pre-Release Versioning

For beta and release candidate versions, append identifiers:

```bash
# Beta releases
4.2.0-beta.1, 4.2.0-beta.2

# Release candidates  
4.2.0-rc.1, 4.2.0-rc.2

# Development builds
4.2.0-dev.20251005
```

## Git Tagging Strategy

### Tag Format
- Production releases: `v4.1.0`
- Pre-releases: `v4.2.0-beta.1`

### Tagging Commands
```bash
# Create and push production tag
git tag -a v4.1.0 -m "Release v4.1.0: Environment management enhancements"
git push origin v4.1.0

# Create pre-release tag
git tag -a v4.2.0-beta.1 -m "Beta release v4.2.0-beta.1"
git push origin v4.2.0-beta.1
```

## Communication Strategy

### Release Notes Template

```markdown
# Event Stream Engine v4.1.0 Release Notes

## Release Type: MINOR
**Impact Level:** Medium - New features, backward compatible

## New Features
- Enhanced environment variable loading with python-dotenv
- Production-ready configuration validation
- Optimized Docker Compose environment management

## Bug Fixes  
- Fixed duplicate dependency entries in requirements.txt
- Resolved test fixture Twilio ID detection issues

## Technical Improvements
- Cloud deployment optimizations
- Enhanced error handling and logging
- Updated dependencies to latest stable versions

## Upgrade Instructions
Safe to upgrade from v4.0.x - no breaking changes.

## Testing
- Full integration test suite passed
- Docker Compose environment validated
- Cloud deployment readiness confirmed
```

## Decision Matrix for Version Increments

When uncertain about version increment, use this decision tree:

```
Is this change breaking existing functionality? 
├── YES → MAJOR version increment
└── NO → Is this adding new functionality?
    ├── YES → MINOR version increment  
    └── NO → PATCH version increment
```

## Tools and Automation

### Recommended Tools
- **Conventional Commits:** For automated version detection
- **Semantic Release:** For automated version bumping and changelog generation
- **Git Hooks:** For validation of version increment appropriateness

### Automation Pipeline
```bash
# Automated version detection from commit messages
feat: new campaign feature → MINOR increment
fix: webhook bug correction → PATCH increment  
feat!: breaking API change → MAJOR increment
```

## Compliance and Audit Trail

### Version Documentation Requirements
- All MAJOR releases require architectural decision records (ADRs)
- MINOR releases require feature documentation updates
- PATCH releases require issue tracking references

### Rollback Strategy
- PATCH versions: Immediate rollback acceptable
- MINOR versions: Staged rollback with feature flags
- MAJOR versions: Full rollback plan with stakeholder coordination
