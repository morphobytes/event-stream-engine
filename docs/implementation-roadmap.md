# Event Stream Engine - Technical Implementation Roadmap

## Implementation Phases Overview

This document outlines the strategic implementation approach for the Event Stream Engine, organized into logical phases that build upon each other while maintaining system stability and demonstrable progress.

## Phase 1: Infrastructure Foundation âœ… COMPLETED

### Deliverables Completed:
- [x] Docker multi-stage build configuration
- [x] Docker Compose orchestration (web, worker, db, redis)
- [x] Flask application factory pattern
- [x] Celery worker integration
- [x] Environment configuration management
- [x] Ngrok tunnel for webhook testing
- [x] Basic health check endpoints

### Key Achievements:
- **Production-ready infrastructure** with proper separation of concerns
- **Development environment** that mirrors production deployment
- **Real-time webhook connectivity** verified through ngrok tunnel
- **Container orchestration** with health checks and dependency management

## Phase 2: Core Data Platform ðŸŽ¯ CURRENT PHASE

### Branch: `feature/model-and-api`
**Focus**: Data Contracts, Database Initialization, Core CRUD API

#### Phase 2.1: Data Modeling & Persistence
**Timeline**: Current Sprint  
**Dependencies**: Phase 1 Infrastructure

##### Deliverables:
- [ ] SQLAlchemy data models (`app/core/models/`)
  - [ ] User model with E.164 phone numbers as PK
  - [ ] Campaign model with JSON configuration
  - [ ] Message model with state machine pattern  
  - [ ] Subscription and event models
- [ ] Database initialization and migrations
- [ ] Connection pooling and transaction management
- [ ] Model validation and constraints

##### Success Criteria:
- Database schema created and validated
- All models have proper relationships and constraints
- Migration system operational
- Data integrity rules enforced

#### Phase 2.2: Webhook Data Ingestion 
**Timeline**: Following 2.1 completion  
**Dependencies**: Data models established

##### Deliverables:
- [ ] Inbound webhook processor (`app/api/webhooks.py`)
- [ ] Status callback processor
- [ ] Raw webhook data storage for audit trail
- [ ] Data validation and normalization layer
- [ ] Error handling and logging

##### Success Criteria:
- Real Twilio webhooks processed and stored
- Raw and normalized data properly separated
- Webhook validation prevents malformed data
- Complete audit trail for compliance

#### Phase 2.3: Core CRUD API
**Timeline**: Parallel with 2.2  
**Dependencies**: Data models established

##### Deliverables:
- [ ] RESTful API endpoints (`app/api/v1/`)
- [ ] User management endpoints
- [ ] Campaign CRUD operations  
- [ ] Message status queries
- [ ] API serialization with Marshmallow
- [ ] Pagination and filtering

##### Success Criteria:
- Complete CRUD operations for all entities
- API follows REST conventions
- Input validation and error handling
- Proper HTTP status codes and responses

#### Phase 3.1: Campaign Orchestration
**Dependencies**: Phase 2 completion

##### Deliverables:
- [ ] Segment evaluation engine
- [ ] Template rendering system
- [ ] Consent and quiet hours enforcement
- [ ] Rate limiting with Redis
- [ ] Celery task definitions
- [ ] Retry logic and error handling

#### Phase 3.2: Message Delivery Pipeline  
**Dependencies**: 3.1 Campaign engine

##### Deliverables:
- [ ] Twilio API integration for sending
- [ ] Message state machine management
- [ ] Delivery tracking and status updates
- [ ] Failed message retry logic
- [ ] Performance monitoring and metrics

## Phase 4: User Experience & Validation ðŸš€ FINAL

### Branch: `feature/ui-and-testing`
**Focus**: Public UI, Aggregated Reports, Comprehensive Testing

#### Phase 4.1: Management Interface
**Dependencies**: Phase 3 completion

##### Deliverables:
- [ ] Web UI for campaign management
- [ ] User management interface
- [ ] Real-time monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Message analytics and reporting

#### Phase 4.2: Testing & Quality Assurance
**Dependencies**: All core functionality complete

##### Deliverables:
- [ ] Unit test suite (70% coverage target)
- [ ] Integration test suite
- [ ] End-to-end workflow tests
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Security testing

## Risk Management & Mitigation

### Technical Risks:
1. **Database Performance**: Mitigated by proper indexing and connection pooling
2. **Webhook Reliability**: Mitigated by raw data storage and retry mechanisms  
3. **Rate Limiting Complexity**: Mitigated by Redis-based counters and sliding windows
4. **Message Delivery Failures**: Mitigated by state machine and retry logic

### Schedule Risks:
1. **Integration Complexity**: Phases designed for incremental validation
2. **Testing Time**: Parallel development of tests with features
3. **Documentation Debt**: Architecture docs created upfront

## Success Metrics

### Phase 2 Metrics:
- [ ] Database schema migration successful
- [ ] All CRUD operations functional
- [ ] Webhook processing under 100ms
- [ ] Zero data loss during ingestion

### Phase 3 Metrics:  
- [ ] Campaign processing under 5 seconds
- [ ] 99%+ message delivery success rate
- [ ] Rate limiting accuracy within 1%
- [ ] Worker auto-scaling operational

### Phase 4 Metrics:
- [ ] UI response times under 200ms
- [ ] 90%+ test coverage achieved
- [ ] E2E test suite runs under 5 minutes
- [ ] Performance benchmarks documented
